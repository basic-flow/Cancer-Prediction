# Breast Cancer Prediction Web App

## Project Overview
This web application predicts whether a patient has breast cancer based on clinical and cytological measurements. Using machine learning (XGBoost), the app outputs the probability of cancer and provides key metrics to assess model performance.

## Performance

| Metric             | Value | Description                                |
|-------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy           | 0.97  | Overall correct predictions                |
| ROC-AUC            | 0.97  | Model‚Äôs ability to discriminate classes   |
| Recall / Sensitivity | 0.97 | Fraction of real cancer cases correctly identified |
| Specificity        | 0.96  | Fraction of healthy patients correctly identified |
